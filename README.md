# learn_pygame

The main idea is just to learn pygame. However beside
that, the whole story has also deeper meaning (true story).

Work college (Dejko) went on vacation in Hawaii. Another college
(mineral collector) ask Dejko to collect some minerals from Hawaii. As
a good samaritan Dejko was collecting minerals, unaware that he is
inside National Park. Of course he was caught by police. So the game
is about Dejko, who is trying to collect minerals and not got caught by police.
